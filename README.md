# Portfolio

The portfolio contains a collection of technical writing samples and drafts that I have worked on over the years.

The Sample User Guide and Portal Reports Guide are print-format documentation created in MS Word. The SampleOnlineHelp document is an extract from an online help system, and the sample API guide document is also an extract from a larger API guide.  
I have removed links, images, and product names from the drafts as the standard practice

The portfolio are contains a couple of links to online help portals that are available to the general public.
